### **Strict Format Guidelines:**

1.  **MCQ Format**: Each MCQ question must follow this structure:

    ```json
    {
        "q_type": "MCQ",
        "question": "Question text here?",
        "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],

    -   Ensure that each question has 4 **distinct** options.
    -   The options should not be trivial and must have one correct answer.
    -   The "correct_answer" field must match exactly one of the options provided.
2.  **Problem Solving Question Format**: Each problem solving question must follow this structure:

    ```json
    {
        "q_type": "problem_solving",
        "problem_description": "Problem description here.",
        "input_format": "Description of the input format here.",
        "output_format": "Description of the output format here.",
        "constraints": "Constraint details here (e.g., input size, value range).",
        "examples": [
            {"input": "Input example 1", "output": "Expected output 1"},
            {"input": "Input example 2", "output": "Expected output 2"}
        ],

----------

### **Output Structure**:
The output should be in JSON format and should contain three fields: `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`, each containing an array of questions formatted as described above.

```json
{
    <questions as per difficulty level>
}

```

----------

### **Additional Notes**:

-   **How many questions to generate based on difficulty level**:

    -   **Easy Level**: You must generate **exactly 20 MCQs**.
        -   These should be purely multiple-choice questions and **no problem solving questions** should be included.
    -   **Medium Level**: You must generate **12 MCQs** and **8 problem solving questions**.
        -   Ensure that the problem solving questions are of **intermediate difficulty** and cover standard algorithms or data structures.
    -   **Hard Level**: You must generate **exactly 20 problem solving questions**.
        -   These should be **advanced**, challenging problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms, system design, or complex data structures.

-   **Do not mix question types within a level**:
    -   For "Easy", only MCQs, no problem solving questions.
    -   For "Medium", 12 MCQs and 8 problem solving questions.
    -   For "Hard", only problem solving questions.
-   **Clarity in the problem description**: Ensure that the problem description for each problem solving questions is **clear, detailed**, and gives enough information for the user to understand the task.

-   **Edge cases**: For each problem solving questions, ensure you provide at least one or more **edge cases** to test the robustness of the solution.

-   **Realistic options for MCQs**: The options for MCQs should be relevant to the question, and avoid options like "None of the above" or "All of the above" unless it fits the question context.

-   **Constraints**: In problem solving questions, constraints should be clearly defined to ensure the question isn't too ambiguous. Make sure the constraints make sense and are reasonable given the problem.

-   **Examples and edge cases**: Every problem solving questions should include at least two examples of typical inputs and outputs, and at least one edge case to ensure the solution works in all scenarios.

-   **Do not include any extra information**: Only include the necessary question information, no additional commentary or explanations.

-   **Avoid trivial or overly simple problems**: For the "Medium" and "Hard" levels, the problems should be challenging and require a solid understanding of concepts. For "Easy" questions, the problems should be basic but still have meaningful options.
