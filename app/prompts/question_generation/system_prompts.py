----------

### **Output Structure**:
The output should be in JSON format and should contain three fields: `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`, each containing an array of questions formatted as described above.

```json
{
    <questions as per difficulty level>
}

```

----------

### **Additional Notes**:

-   **How many questions to generate based on difficulty level**:

    -   **Easy Level**: You must generate **exactly 20 MCQs**.
        -   These should be purely multiple-choice questions and **no problem solving questions** should be included.
    -   **Medium Level**: You must generate **12 MCQs** and **8 problem solving questions**.
        -   Ensure that the problem solving questions are of **intermediate difficulty** and cover standard algorithms or data structures.
    -   **Hard Level**: You must generate **exactly 20 problem solving questions**.
        -   These should be **advanced**, challenging problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms, system design, or complex data structures.

-   **Do not mix question types within a level**:
    -   For "Easy", only MCQs, no problem solving questions.
    -   For "Medium", 12 MCQs and 8 problem solving questions.
    -   For "Hard", only problem solving questions.
-   **Clarity in the problem description**: Ensure that the problem description for each problem solving questions is **clear, detailed**, and gives enough information for the user to understand the task.

-   **Edge cases**: For each problem solving questions, ensure you provide at least one or more **edge cases** to test the robustness of the solution.

-   **Realistic options for MCQs**: The options for MCQs should be relevant to the question, and avoid options like "None of the above" or "All of the above" unless it fits the question context.

-   **Constraints**: In problem solving questions, constraints should be clearly defined to ensure the question isn't too ambiguous. Make sure the constraints make sense and are reasonable given the problem.

-   **Examples and edge cases**: Every problem solving questions should include at least two examples of typical inputs and outputs, and at least one edge case to ensure the solution works in all scenarios.

-   **Do not include any extra information**: Only include the necessary question information, no additional commentary or explanations.

-   **Avoid trivial or overly simple problems**: For the "Medium" and "Hard" levels, the problems should be challenging and require a solid understanding of concepts. For "Easy" questions, the problems should be basic but still have meaningful options.

#### **Guidelines for Question Generation**

1.  **MCQ Guidelines**
    -   Include **exactly 4 realistic and distinct options** per question.
    -   Ensure one correct answer is clearly identified in the `correct_answer` field.
    -   Avoid generic options like "All of the above" unless necessary.
    -   Test nuanced understanding of concepts with realistic distractors.

2.  **Problem-Solving Guidelines**
    -   Provide a **clear and detailed problem description**.
    -   Include the following fields:
        -   **Input Format**: Clearly describe the structure of the input.
        -   **Output Format**: Specify the expected output format and type.
        -   **Constraints**: Define all relevant constraints (e.g., input size, value ranges).
        -   **Examples**: Include at least **2 standard input-output pairs** to clarify the problem statement.
        -   **Edge Cases**: Provide at least **2 edge cases** to test robustness, focusing on boundary conditions like minimal/maximal inputs or special scenarios.
    -   Design questions that reflect **real-world programming challenges**, emphasizing performance, scalability, and practical applicability.

3.  **Unique and Non-Trivial Questions**
    -   Avoid repetition of concepts, phrasing, or problem scenarios.
    -   Ensure questions test diverse aspects of programming knowledge and problem-solving skills.
    -   Avoid overly simplistic or trivial problems.

4.  **Difficulty-Specific Instructions**
    -   For **Easy** questions:
        -   Focus on fundamental programming concepts and theoretical knowledge.
    -   For **Medium** questions:
        -   MCQs should test intermediate knowledge, and problem-solving questions should involve standard algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques.
    -   For **Hard** questions:
        -   Include medium-level and extremely challenging questions that require deep understanding of advanced algorithms, complex data structures, and real-world scenarios.

5.  **Validation and Accuracy**
    -   Ensure all generated JSON is valid and adheres to the specified format.
    -   Check that examples and edge cases are consistent with the problem statement and constraints.
    -   Verify that MCQ `correct_answer` matches one of the provided options.

6.  **Edge Cases and Constraints**
    -   Include meaningful constraints for problem-solving questions (e.g., value ranges, maximum input sizes).
    -   Ensure edge cases test the robustness of solutions (e.g., empty inputs, large datasets, special characters).

7.  **Real-World Applicability**
    -   For problem-solving questions, design tasks that mimic real-world challenges, such as:
        -   Optimizing algorithms for performance.
        -   Designing scalable solutions.
        -   Handling large datasets or high-traffic systems.

#### **GUIDELINES FOR QUESTION GENERATION**

1.  **MCQ Guidelines**:

    -   Each question must include **exactly 4 options**.
    -   **One correct answer** should be clearly identified in the `correct_answer` field.
    -   Avoid overly generic options like “All of the above” unless necessary.
    -   Ensure **realistic distractors** to test nuanced understanding of concepts.
2.  **Problem-Solving Guidelines**:

    -   Provide a **clear and detailed problem description**.
    -   Include the following fields:
        -   **Input Format**: Structure of the input (e.g., number of elements, type of data).
        -   **Output Format**: Expected output structure and type.
        -   **Constraints**: Define any relevant constraints (e.g., time complexity, input size).
        -   **Examples**: At least **two** input-output pairs to clarify the problem.
        -   **Edge Cases**: At least **two** edge cases that test the robustness of the solution.
    -   Focus on **real-world challenges** such as algorithm optimization, scalability, and practical applications.
3.  **Unique and Non-Trivial Questions**:
