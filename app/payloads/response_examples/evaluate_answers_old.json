In such cases, the maximum product can be achieved by either multiplying the three largest positive numbers or by multiplying the two smallest (most negative) numbers with the largest positive number. This case is not considered in the current implementation.\n2. The function sorts the entire list, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). This can be improved by finding the three largest numbers and two smallest numbers in a single pass through the list, which would have a time complexity of O(n).\n3. The function could benefit from more descriptive variable names for better readability."
